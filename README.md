This Project is about managing credit cards for the users. From the existing cards when a user goes to buy groceries, 
gas, online shiopping or other categories from those item a best suited card will be displayed to use. This will offer the best reward for the credit card for a particular category gaining the ability to receive a maximum reward. Those rewards points will be stored and kept track of them so the user can use them when needed and take full advantage to the rewards offer by the credit card companies.
